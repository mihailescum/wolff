A library for running the Wolff algorithm on arbitrary systems in arbitrary
fields. A "spin state" and "spin symmetry transformation" type must be
supplied to define a system, along with a spin-spin coupling, a spin-field
coupling, and a generator of transformations of rank two. The library then
supplies the tools to run Wolff cluster-flip Monte Carlo on the resulting
system, with arbitrary measurements taken along the way.

See INSTALL for installation details.
