Several examples are included in the directory :file:`examples/`, including using site dependent fields, compiling without a field, using the same spin type for multiple transformation types, and more.

The simplist, standalone example :file:`examples/ising_standalone.cpp` of measuring the average cluster size of an Ising model is provided in full below, demonstrating how to define a model, measurement, couplings, and initialize the algorithm.
