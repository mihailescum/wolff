To install, initialize cmake in a build directory, e.g.,

# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
# make

The core library requires only the standard C++ libraries and a modern
compiler. Most of the example code also has no dependencies. Compilation of
examples/tools/analyze_correlations.cpp requires the FFTW3 library.
