To build all examples and install the library, initialize cmake in a build
directory, e.g.,

# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
# make
# make install

The core library requires only the standard C++ libraries and a modern
compiler. Most of the example code also has no dependencies, with the exception
of ising_animation, which requires the glut library.

The documentation can be built into a variety of formats using Sphinx. To list available options,

# cd doc
# mkdir _build
# make

Building the documentation on the website is accomplished by then running

# make html

To compile the examples which render their output to the screen, please install GLFW 3.3
